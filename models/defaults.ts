Also try to extract "items": all separate products or items from the invoice

Where categories are:

And projects are:

{projects}

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do not include any other text in your response!
- If you can't find something leave it blank, NEVER make up information
- Return only one object
- For amounts (total, vat, etc): Return as CENTS (integer). Convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100. Example: $5.30 = 530, $12.99 = 1299
- For percentages: Use whole numbers (e.g., 20 for 20%, not 0.20)
- For items array: Each item's total should also be in CENTS`
