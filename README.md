TaxHacker is a self-hosted accounting app designed for freelancers, indie hackers, and small businesses who want to save time and automate expense and income tracking using the power of modern AI.

Upload photos of receipts, invoices, or PDFs, and TaxHacker will automatically recognize and extract all the important data you need for accounting: product names, amounts, items, dates, merchants, taxes, and save it into a structured Excel-like database. Bulk import transactions from CSV files with smart format detection for Amazon Business Order Reports, American Express statements, and custom formats—with intelligent duplicate prevention to keep your records clean.

The app features automatic currency conversion (including crypto!) based on historical exchange rates from the transaction date. With built-in filtering, multi-project support, import/export capabilities, custom categories, and advanced CSV import with duplicate matching, TaxHacker simplifies reporting and makes tax filing a bit easier.

## ✨ Features

### `1` Analyze photos and invoices with AI

![Currency Conversion](public/landing/ai-scanner-big.webp)

Snap a photo of any receipt or upload an invoice PDF, and TaxHacker will automatically recognize, extract, categorize, and store all the information in a structured database.

- **Upload and organize your docs**: Store multiple documents in "unsorted" until you're ready to process them manually or with AI assistance
- **AI data extraction**: Use AI to automatically pull key information like dates, amounts, vendors, and line items
- **Auto-categorization**: Transactions are automatically sorted into relevant categories based on their content
- **Item splitting**: Extract individual items from invoices and split them into separate transactions when needed
- **Structured storage**: Everything gets saved in an organized database for easy filtering and retrieval
- **Customizable AI providers**: Choose from OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Mistral (local LLM support coming soon)

TaxHacker works with a wide variety of documents, including store receipts, restaurant bills, invoices, bank statements, letters, even handwritten receipts. It handles any language and any currency with ease.

### `2` Import from CSV with smart format detection and duplicate matching

![CSV Import](public/landing/transactions-big.webp)

Import transactions in bulk from CSV files with automatic format detection and intelligent duplicate prevention. TaxHacker recognizes different CSV formats and adapts processing accordingly.

- **Multi-format support**: Automatically detects Amazon Business Order Reports, American Express statements, and generic CSV files
- **Smart aggregation**: Amazon CSVs with multiple item rows are automatically grouped into single transactions (typically 80-85% reduction in duplicate entries)
- **Duplicate detection**: Advanced matching algorithm prevents duplicate imports by comparing amounts and dates (±3 days tolerance)
- **Auto-merge capability**: High-confidence matches (≥90%) are automatically merged; medium-confidence (70-89%) flagged for manual review
- **Business metadata**: Captures GL codes, departments, cost centers, project codes, and custom fields from Amazon Business reports
- **Line item preservation**: Multi-item orders maintain full detail with ASIN, brand, pricing breakdown, and individual item information
- **Import history**: Track all CSV imports with detailed statistics, review flagged matches, and audit merged transactions
- **Flexible mapping**: Generic CSVs allow custom column mapping to match your data structure

TaxHacker intelligently processes your data: Amazon orders with 14 items become a single transaction with line items, while AmEx statements import row-by-row. The matching system uses payment amounts and dates to prevent duplicates across multiple imports.

### `3` Multi-currency support with automatic conversion (even crypto!)

![Currency Conversion](public/landing/multi-currency.webp)

TaxHacker automatically detects currencies in your documents and converts them to your base currency using historical exchange rates.

- **Foreight currency detection**: Automatically identify the currency used in any document
- **Historical rates**: Get conversion rates from the actual transaction date
- **All-world coverage**: Support for 170+ world currencies and 14 popular cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, DOT, and more)
- **Flexible input**: Manual entry is always available when you need more control

### `4` Organize your transactions using fully customizable categories, projects and fields

## 🛳 Deployment and Self-hosting

TaxHacker can be easily self-hosted on your own infrastructure for complete control over your data and application environment. We provide a [Docker image](./Dockerfile) and [Docker Compose](./docker-compose.yml) setup that makes deployment simple:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vas3k/TaxHacker/main/docker-compose.yml

docker compose up
```

The Docker Compose setup includes:

- TaxHacker application container
- PostgreSQL 17 database (or connect to your existing database)
- Automatic database migrations on startup
- Volume mounts for persistent data storage
- Production-ready configuration

New Docker images are automatically built and published with every release. You can use specific version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`) or `latest` for the most recent version.

For advanced setups, you can customize the Docker Compose configuration to fit your infrastructure. The default configuration uses the pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry, but you can also build locally using the provided [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).

Example custom configuration:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/vas3k/taxhacker:latest
    ports:
      - "7331:7331"
    environment:
      - SELF_HOSTED_MODE=true
      - UPLOAD_PATH=/app/data/uploads
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/taxhacker
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Environment Variables

Configure TaxHacker for your specific needs with these environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Description | Example |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `UPLOAD_PATH` | Yes | Local directory for file uploads and storage | `./data/uploads` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgresql://user@localhost:5432/taxhacker` |
| `PORT` | No | Port to run the application on | `7331` (default) |
| `BASE_URL` | No | Base URL for the application | `http://localhost:7331` |

**CSV Import Matching:**
- When `RECEIPT_MATCH_ENABLED=true`, imported CSV transactions are automatically checked for duplicates
- Matches ≥90% confidence (or custom threshold) are auto-merged
- Matches 70-89% confidence are flagged for manual review
- Import history tracks all merges and allows reviewing flagged matches

You can also configure LLM provider settings in the application or via environment variables:

- **OpenAI**: `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Google Gemini**: `GOOGLE_MODEL_NAME` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- **Mistral**: `MISTRAL_MODEL_NAME` and `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
